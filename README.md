# RandomProjection

In the Bioinformatic Algorithms lesson, we learned how works random projection algorithm. And I decided to make a project about this. In this project my aim is finding motifs using random projection. For more information about random projection, please read Jeremy Buhler and Martin Tompa's "Finding Motifs Using Random Projections" article.

So, I want to show how works my codes. Thhis solution
Firstly,
