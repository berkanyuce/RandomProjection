# RandomProjection

In the Bioinformatic Algorithms lesson, we learned how works random projection algorithm. And I decided to make a project about this. In this project my aim is finding motifs using random projection. For more information about random projection, please read Jeremy Buhler and Martin Tompa's "Finding Motifs Using Random Projections" article.

So, I want to show how works my codes.
Firstly, we should get some variables from user. These are DNA, Squence Number and Sequence Length. This program generates a motif length, mutasion number by using this variables. And then, It defines a projection again with these variables.

After that, loop starts. Generate random starting points and save the applicant motifs to a matrix. Then, It checks the applicant motifs are a motif or not. If yes, we got it. Else, try another time.

I want to explain all these with pseudo code and some images.
